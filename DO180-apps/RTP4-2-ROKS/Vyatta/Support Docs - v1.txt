Hi Team,

Thank you for your update.
When you route the VLAN traffic through vyatta gateway device, you need to have the required configuration for that VLAN in vyatta mentioned in the document so that the VLAN traffic will get pass through the vyatta without any issues. Also, the vyatta router cannot route the traffic meant for an associated VLAN without the VRRP IP of vyatta private and public interface so we are deleting the disable commands.

We can understand that you were unable to access the IP 158.177.192.115 part of secondary subnet VLAN 969 once you have routed the VLAN through vyatta device so please add the below command.

set interfaces bonding dp0bond1 vif 969 vrrp vrrp-group 1 virtual-address 158.177.192.113/29

Please follow the below steps and let us know if you are still facing an issue accessing the application.

Step 1:Please add the below commands in vyatta.
set interfaces bonding dp0bond1 vif 969 address 192.168.132.1/30
set interfaces bonding dp0bond1 vif 969 vrrp vrrp-group 1 preempt false
set interfaces bonding dp0bond1 vif 969 vrrp vrrp-group 1 priority 254
set interfaces bonding dp0bond1 vif 969 vrrp vrrp-group 1 sync-group vgroup1
set interfaces bonding dp0bond1 vif 969 vrrp vrrp-group 1 virtual-address 158.177.220.81/28
set interfaces bonding dp0bond1 vif 969 vrrp vrrp-group 1 virtual-address 158.177.192.113/29

Step 2:Please run the below commands to enable the VRRP IP's.
configure
delete interfaces bonding dp0bond0 vrrp vrrp-group 1 disable
delete interfaces bonding dp0bond1 vrrp vrrp-group 1 disable
commit

Step 3:
Please go to https://cloud.ibm.com/netsec/gateway-appliances-->Select gateway device-->Manage VLAN-->Select VLAN-->Change the status to route through.

So please add the above configuration and let us know more details if you are still facing an issue accessing the IP 158.177.192.115 so we will check further on this issue.
Thanks again, have a nice day.


Kind Regards
